	2) fsck <patition path> and follow the instructions 

2. How to gdb debug guest kernel
	1) locate the debugger: can be found in <xen-source-directory>/tools/debugger/gdbsx
	2) connect gdbsx to vm: 
			sudo ./gdbsx -a domid <32|64> PORT
			usually choose 64 bit and PORT can choose randomly, e.g. 9999
			If successful, a message like this will show:
				Listening on port 9999
			And VM will be paused. 
	3) connect gdb to gdbsx:
			locate the guest kernel binary, and lauch gdb:
				gdb ./vmlinux
			connect to the same port as specified in the previous step: (PORT 9999)
				 target remote <domain0 ip>:9999
			in our case, ip is localhost.
