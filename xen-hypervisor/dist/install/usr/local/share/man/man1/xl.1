.SH "NAME"
xl \- Xen management tool, based on LibXenlight
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBxl\fR \fIsubcommand\fR [\fIargs\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBxl\fR program is the new tool for managing Xen guest
domains. The program can be used to create, pause, and shutdown
domains. It can also be used to list current domains, enable or pin
VCPUs, and attach or detach virtual block devices.
.PP
The basic structure of every \fBxl\fR command is almost always:
.Sp
.RS 2
\&\fBxl\fR \fIsubcommand\fR [\fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR] \fIdomain-id\fR
.RE
.PP
Where \fIsubcommand\fR is one of the subcommands listed below, \fIdomain-id\fR
is the numeric domain id, or the domain name (which will be internally
translated to domain id), and \fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR are subcommand specific
options.  There are a few exceptions to this rule in the cases where
the subcommand in question acts on all domains, the entire machine,
or directly on the Xen hypervisor.  Those exceptions will be clear for
each of those subcommands.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
.IP "start the script \fB/etc/init.d/xencommons\fR at boot time" 4
.IX Item "start the script /etc/init.d/xencommons at boot time"
Most \fBxl\fR operations rely upon \fBxenstored\fR and \fBxenconsoled\fR: make
sure you start the script \fB/etc/init.d/xencommons\fR at boot time to
initialize all the daemons needed by \fBxl\fR.
.IP "setup a \fBxenbr0\fR bridge in dom0" 4
.IX Item "setup a xenbr0 bridge in dom0"
In the most common network configuration, you need to setup a bridge in dom0
named \fBxenbr0\fR in order to have a working network in the guest domains.
Please refer to the documentation of your Linux distribution to know how to
setup the bridge.
.IP "\fBautoballoon\fR" 4
.IX Item "autoballoon"
If you specify the amount of memory dom0 has, passing \fBdom0_mem\fR to
Xen, it is highly recommended to disable \fBautoballoon\fR. Edit
\&\fB/etc/xen/xl.conf\fR and set it to 0.
.IP "run xl as \fBroot\fR" 4
.IX Item "run xl as root"
Most \fBxl\fR commands require root privileges to run due to the
communications channels used to talk to the hypervisor.  Running as
non root will return an error.
.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
.IX Header "GLOBAL OPTIONS"
Some global options are always available:
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Verbose.
.IP "\fB\-N\fR" 4
.IX Item "-N"
Dry run: do not actually execute the command.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
Force execution: xl will refuse to run some commands if it detects that xend is
also running, this option will force the execution of those commands, even
though it is unsafe.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t"
Always use carriage-return-based overwriting for displaying progress
messages without scrolling the screen.  Without \-t, this is done only
if stderr is a tty.
.SH "DOMAIN SUBCOMMANDS"
.IX Header "DOMAIN SUBCOMMANDS"
The following subcommands manipulate domains directly.  As stated
previously, most commands take \fIdomain-id\fR as the first parameter.
.IP "\fBbutton-press\fR \fIdomain-id\fR \fIbutton\fR" 4
.IX Item "button-press domain-id button"
\&\fIThis command is deprecated. Please use \f(CI\*(C`xl trigger\*(C'\fI instead.\fR
.Sp
Indicate an \s-1ACPI\s0 button press to the domain, where \fIbutton\fR can be 'power' or
\&'sleep'. This command is only available for \s-1HVM\s0 domains.
.IP "\fBcreate\fR [\fIconfigfile\fR] [\fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR]" 4
.IX Item "create [configfile] [OPTIONS]"
The create subcommand takes a config file as its first argument: see
\&\fBxl.cfg\fR\|(5) for full details of the file format and possible options.
If \fIconfigfile\fR is missing \fBxl\fR creates the domain assuming the default
values for every option.
.Sp
\&\fIconfigfile\fR has to be an absolute path to a file.
.Sp
Create will return \fBas soon\fR as the domain is started.  This \fBdoes
not\fR mean the guest \s-1OS\s0 in the domain has actually booted, or is
available for input.
.Sp
If the \fI\-F\fR option is specified, create will start the domain and not
return until its death.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR
.RS 4

.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
Leave the domain paused after it is created.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F"
Run in foreground until death of the domain.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-vncviewer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --vncviewer"
Attach to domain's \s-1VNC\s0 server, forking a vncviewer process.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-vncviewer\-autopass\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A, --vncviewer-autopass"
Pass the \s-1VNC\s0 password to vncviewer via stdin.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Attach console to the domain as soon as it has started.  This is
useful for determining issues with crashing domains and just as a
general convenience since you often want to watch the
domain boot.
.IP "\fBkey=value\fR" 4
.IX Item "key=value"
It is possible to pass \fIkey=value\fR pairs on the command line to provide
options as if they were written in the configuration file; these override
whatever is in the \fIconfigfile\fR.
.Sp
\&\s-1NB:\s0 Many config options require characters such as quotes or brackets
which are interpreted by the shell (and often discarded) before being
passed to xl, resulting in xl being unable to parse the value
correctly.  A simple work-around is to put all extra options within a
single set of quotes, separated by semicolons.  (See below for an example.)

Update the saved configuration for a running domain. This has no
immediate effect but will be applied when the guest is next
restarted. This command is useful to ensure that runtime modifications
made to the guest will be preserved when the guest is restarted.
.Sp
Since Xen 4.5 xl has improved capabilities to handle dynamic domain
configuration changes and will preserve any changes made at runtime
when necessary. Therefore it should not normally be necessary to use
this command any more.

Immediately terminate the domain specified by \fIdomain-id\fR.  This doesn't give
the domain \s-1OS\s0 any chance to react, and is the equivalent of ripping the power
cord out on a physical machine.  In most cases you will want to use the

Name is the name of the domain.  \s-1ID\s0 the numeric domain id.  Mem is the
desired amount of memory to allocate to the domain (although it may

below).  Time is the total run time of the domain as accounted for by
Xen.

The domain is currently running on a \s-1CPU.\s0
.IP "\fBb \- blocked\fR" 4
.IX Item "b - blocked"
The domain is blocked, and not running or runnable.  This can be because the
domain is waiting on \s-1IO\s0 (a traditional wait state) or has
gone to sleep because there was nothing else for it to do.
.IP "\fBp \- paused\fR" 4
.IX Item "p - paused"
The domain has been paused, usually occurring through the administrator
running \fBxl pause\fR.  When in a paused state the domain will still
consume allocated resources (like memory), but will not be eligible for

The Time column is deceptive.  Virtual \s-1IO\s0 (network and block devices)
used by the domains requires coordination by Domain0, which means that
Domain0 is actually charged for much of the time that a DomainU is
doing \s-1IO.\s0  Use of this time value to determine relative utilizations
by domains is thus very unreliable, as a high \s-1IO\s0 workload may show as
less utilized than a high \s-1CPU\s0 workload.  Consider yourself warned.

.IP "\fBmem-max\fR \fIdomain-id\fR \fImem\fR" 4

Specify the maximum amount of memory the domain is able to use, appending 't'
for terabytes, 'g' for gigabytes, 'm' for megabytes, 'k' for kilobytes and 'b'
for bytes.
.Sp
The mem-max value may not correspond to the actual memory used in the
domain, as it may balloon down its memory to give more back to the \s-1OS.\s0
.Sp
The value given just sets the memory amount the domain is allowed to allocate
in the hypervisor. It can't be set lower than the current reservation, but
it is allowed to be higher than the configured maximum memory size of the
domain (\fBmaxmem\fR parameter in the domain's configuration). Using \fBxl mem-max\fR
to set the maximum memory above the initial \fBmaxmem\fR value will not allow the
additional memory to be used via \fBxl mem-set\fR. The initial \fBmaxmem\fR value is
still used as an upper limit for \fBxl mem-set\fR.
.Sp
The domain will not receive any signal regarding the changed memory limit.

Set the domain's used memory using the balloon driver; append 't' for

Because this operation requires cooperation from the domain operating
system, there is no guarantee that it will succeed.  This command will
definitely not work unless the domain has the required paravirt
driver.

.IX Item "vcpu-pin [-f|--force] domain-id vcpu cpus hard cpus soft"
Set hard and soft affinity for a \fIvcpu\fR of <domain\-id>. Normally VCPUs
can float between available CPUs whenever Xen deems a different run state
is appropriate.
.Sp
Hard affinity can be used to restrict this, by ensuring certain VCPUs
can only run on certain physical CPUs. Soft affinity specifies a \fIpreferred\fR
set of CPUs. Soft affinity needs special support in the scheduler, which is
only provided in credit1.
.Sp
The keyword \fBall\fR can be used to apply the hard and soft affinity masks to
all the VCPUs in the domain. The symbol '\-' can be used to leave either
hard or soft affinity alone.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& xl vcpu\-pin 0 3 \- 6\-9
.Ve
.Sp
will set soft affinity for vCPU 3 of domain 0 to pCPUs 6,7,8 and 9,
leaving its hard affinity untouched. On the other hand:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& xl vcpu\-pin 0 3 3,4 6\-9
.Ve
.Sp
will set both hard and soft affinity, the former to pCPUs 3 and 4, the
latter to pCPUs 6,7,8, and 9.
.Sp
Specifying \fI\-f\fR or \fI\-\-force\fR will remove a temporary pinning done by the
operating system (normally this should be done by the operating system).
In case a temporary pinning is active for a vcpu the affinity of this vcpu
can't be changed without this option.

Timeslice tells the scheduler how long to allow VMs to run before
pre-empting.  The default is 30ms.  Valid ranges are 1ms to 1000ms.
The length of the timeslice (in ms) must be higher than the length of
the ratelimit (see below).

Ratelimit attempts to limit the number of schedules per second.  It
sets a minimum amount of time (in microseconds) a \s-1VM\s0 must run before
we will allow a higher-priority \s-1VM\s0 to pre-empt it.  The default value
is 1000 microseconds (1ms).  Valid range is 100 to 500000 (500ms).
The ratelimit length must be lower than the timeslice length.
.IP "\fB\-m \s-1DELAY\s0\fR, \fB\-\-migration_delay_us=DELAY\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m DELAY, --migration_delay_us=DELAY"
Migration delay specifies for how long a vCPU, after it stopped running should
be considered \*(L"cache-hot\*(R". Basically, if less than \s-1DELAY\s0 us passed since when
the vCPU was executing on a \s-1CPU,\s0 it is likely that most of the vCPU's working
set is still in the \s-1CPU\s0's cache, and therefore the vCPU is not migrated.
.Sp
Default is 0. Maximum is 100 ms. This can be effective at preventing vCPUs
to bounce among CPUs too quickly, but, at the same time, the scheduler stops
being fully work-conserving.

\&\fB\s-1FLASK\s0\fR is a security framework that defines a mandatory access control policy
providing fine-grained controls over Xen domains, allowing the policy writer
to define what interactions between domains, devices, and the hypervisor are

 \- Prevent two domains from communicating via event channels or grants
 \- Control which domains can use device passthrough (and which devices)
 \- Restrict or audit operations performed by privileged domains
 \- Prevent a privileged domain from arbitrarily mapping pages from other
   domains.

Intel Haswell and later server platforms offer monitoring capability in each
logical processor to measure specific platform shared resource metric, for
example, L3 cache occupancy. In the Xen implementation, the monitoring
granularity is domain level. To monitor a specific domain, just attach the
domain id with the monitoring service. When the domain doesn't need to be
monitored any more, detach the domain id from the monitoring service.
.PP
Intel Broadwell and later server platforms also offer total/local memory
bandwidth monitoring. Xen supports per-domain monitoring for these two
additional monitoring types. Both memory bandwidth monitoring and L3 cache
occupancy monitoring share the same set of underlying monitoring service. Once
a domain is attached to the monitoring service, monitoring data can be shown
for any of these monitoring types.
.PP
There is no cache monitoring and memory bandwidth monitoring on L2 cache so
far.

Intel Broadwell and later server platforms offer capabilities to configure and
make use of the Cache Allocation Technology (\s-1CAT\s0) mechanisms, which enable more
cache resources (i.e. L3/L2 cache) to be made available for high priority
applications. In the Xen implementation, \s-1CAT\s0 is used to control cache allocation
on \s-1VM\s0 basis. To enforce cache on a specific domain, just set capacity bitmasks
(\s-1CBM\s0) for the domain.
.PP
Intel Broadwell and later server platforms also offer Code/Data Prioritization
(\s-1CDP\s0) for cache allocations, which support specifying code or data cache for
applications. \s-1CDP\s0 is used on a per \s-1VM\s0 basis in the Xen implementation. To
specify code or data \s-1CBM\s0 for the domain, \s-1CDP\s0 feature must be enabled and \s-1CBM\s0
type options need to be specified when setting \s-1CBM,\s0 and the type options (code
and data) are mutually exclusive. There is no \s-1CDP\s0 support on L2 so far.
