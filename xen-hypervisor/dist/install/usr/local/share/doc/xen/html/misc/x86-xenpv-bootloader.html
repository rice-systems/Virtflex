<h1>Xen x86 PV Bootloader Protocol</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>One method for booting an x86 Xen PV guest is to use a PV bootloader,
that is, a bootloader which is itself a PV kernel but which behaves as
a bootloader (examples include the pvgrub-legacy and grub2 targeting
Xen).</p>

<p>In many cases the user wishes to manage this PV bootloader from within
the guest, and therefore wishes to chainload something from the guest
filesystem, most likely via a stage 1 PV bootloader provided by dom0.</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to define the paths within the guest
filesystem where a stage 1 bootloader should look for the in-guest PV
bootloader to load and the protocol/format expected from the
to-be-chainloaded bootloader.</p>

<h2>Protocol</h2>

<p>The bootloader binary should be an ELF file of the appropriate type
(32- or 64-bit). It should contain the standard Xen ELF notes allowing
it to be loaded by the Xen toolstack domain builder (TBD: Reference).</p>

<h2>Path</h2>

<p>The second stage bootloader should be installed into the guest
filesystem as:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/boot/xen/pvboot-&lt;ARCH&gt;.elf</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Where <code>&lt;ARCH&gt;</code> is the first element of the GNU triplet e.g. one of:</p>

<ul>
<li>i386 (nb only i386, not i686 etc), corresponding to the Xen
x86_32(p) arch;</li>
<li>x86_64, corresponding to the Xen x86_64 arch;</li>
</ul>

<p>It is allowable for <code>/boot</code> to be a separate filesystem from <code>/</code> and
therefore stage 1 bootloaders should search
<code>/boot/xen/pvboot-&lt;ARCH&gt;.elf</code> and <code>/xen/pvboot-&lt;ARCH&gt;.elf</code> (in that
order). The <code>xen</code> directory should be on the same filesystem as /boot
and therefore it is not necessary to search for /pvboot-<ARCH>.elf.</p>

<p>It is not in general possible under Xen for a bootloader to boot a
kernel of a different width from itself, and this extends to
chainloading from a stage one. Therefore it is permissible to have
both <code>/boot/xen/pvboot-i386.elf</code> and <code>/boot/xen/pvboot-x86\_64.elf</code>
present in a guest to be used by the appropriate stage 1 (e.g. for
systems with 32-bit userspace and an optional 64-bit kernel).</p>
